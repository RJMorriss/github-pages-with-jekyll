  With this new two week long project the goal was to design an AI snake capable of surviving and conquering many different challenges such as living for as long as possible, growing as long as possible, or occupying all four corners of the board. Originally my teamate and I decided to create a snake the thinks and moves algorithmicly avoiding colliding with itself. Unfortunatly, close to the end of the project my partner was unavailable to work and our snake was... less than adequate. To counter this I changed my snake to run to the nearest wall and then circle around the outside of the map, this gave me a snake the could survive a moderate amout of time but was nothing truely record setting.

  The role I played for my team had me end up design all the functions of the final version of the snake, this wasn't due to a lack of participation by my teamate but because he was unavailable after the the redesign of the snake. However, I created all of the movement functions for the snake. ![Circular movement function](file:///private/var/ablock/Downloads/carbon.png)
  
  Thinking algorithmically essentially boils down to deciding the best move to make before and after every move, in other words, to determine how you should continue based on passing the current situation through a series of equations, parameters, and checks.
