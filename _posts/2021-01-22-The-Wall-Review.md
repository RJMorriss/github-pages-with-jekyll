I remember it so you don't have to Pink Floyd the wall or is it Pink Floyd's The Wall I never know where to put the s there, it's an abstract musical that musician
Roger Waters described as a separation between a rock star and his audience but it's so much more than that. I think when it came out in 1982 we got mixed reviews
and did only OK at the box office many saw it as too pretentious and full of itself saying it's it was just before dusk one weekend evening well on your way when all
the critics told you Pink Floyd's what was shite when you thought it was kind of all right and the masses gave bangs is the movie Ted aiding to
obscurity for a while the odd house ego trip had fallen then slip to the bargain bin for $3.93.
